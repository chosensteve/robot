CODE FOR ULTRASONIC SENSOR 

 This is a complete and refined code for the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino Uno.
 It measures the distance to an object in centimeters and includes a timeout for better performance.

 Define the pins for the trigger (sends the pulse) and echo (receives the pulse).
#define trigPin 9
#define echoPin 10

 Define variables to store the pulse duration (in microseconds) and the calculated distance (in cm).
long duration;
int distance;

void setup() {
   Start serial communication at a 9600 baud rate to display results on the Serial Monitor.
  Serial.begin(9600);

   Set the trigger pin as an OUTPUT because we will send a signal from it.
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
   Set the echo pin as an INPUT because we will listen for a signal on it.
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
}
